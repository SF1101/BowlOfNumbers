Here I will go through the functions of the program, what it does and what it should do.

1. Imagine you have a bowl of tickets, each ticket contains a number, from range 0-X. 
X = the number you try to find
2. You draw one ticket at a time, after each draw, you put the ticket back in the bowl and shuffle the tickets.
3. Repeat this until you found the number you're trying to guess.
This is the programs function, it will repeat numbers, it logs the amount of guesses (tries) and it logs every number it draws.

When starting the program, you will be given the chance to choose a number. Enter the number you want, and press "Enter".
After this, the number will proceed like explained above. 
When the number is found, it will stop guessing. 
Have fun.
